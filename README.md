# Sort YouTube Videos

Additional sorting options for YouTube channel videos.

# Why?

YouTube only offers few **sorting** options, But, I want to use some other sorting options like Sort videos by least views to most viewed, sort by video duration...etc.

**_No API key is required_**

## Installation

with npm:

```
npm install sort-youtube-videos
```

with yarn:

```
yarn add sort-youtube-videos
```

## Usage

```javascript
// adding soon
```

# Sorting options:

- Sort by views (least viewed video to most viewed video `1 view - 1M views`)
- Sort by video duration
- More sorting options coming soon
